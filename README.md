# Chapter Evaluator

This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to use ChatGPT to evaluate your novel chapter.

### Why I write this extension

Every person has a dream to write a novel some day. But we all left this dream behind when struggling in the real life.

Recently, I picked up this dream, started writing a novel. I don't want to publish it, don't want to be famous, just want to answer an old dream.

I am a programmer, so I put my novel in github, in markdown format. And use ChatGPT to evaluate every chapter. But it is not very convenient. And today is St. Patrick day, in Irealand, it is a public holiday. So I spent one day, finish this extension.

Hope one day, I can finish my novel.

You need to wait a while, the ChatGPT will return its evaluation. Like below:

This is an evaluation of Farewell to Arms

Note: From v0.7.x , it starts to support local models (ollama).

But the results are terrible (tested with llama3).

Hope in future, the local models will be more powerful and smarter.
